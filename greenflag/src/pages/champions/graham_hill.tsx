              description="Graham Hill was born in Hampstead, London, to stockbroker Norman Herbert Devereux Hill and Constance Mary (nÃ©e Philp). He attended Hendon Technical College and began working as an apprentice engineer at Smiths Instruments. Conscription led him to the Royal Navy, where he served as an Engine Room Artificer on the light cruiser HMS Swiftsure, eventually reaching the rank of petty officer. After his naval service, he returned to Smiths Instruments.

Hill didn't pass his driving test until the age of 24. Initially interested in motorcycles, his focus shifted to car racing in 1954 after seeing an advertisement for the Universal Motor Racing Club at Brands Hatch, offering laps for five shillings."/>
