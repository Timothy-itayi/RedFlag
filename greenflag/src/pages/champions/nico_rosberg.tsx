To prepare for the season, he achieved the highest score ever in Williams's Engineering Aptitude Test, focusing intensely on car mechanics and Formula One engineering aspects. Assigned to race engineer Tony Ross, Rosberg made his debut at the Bahrain Grand Prix, where he scored his first career points with a seventh-place finish and set the race's fastest lap, becoming the youngest fastest lap setter in history at the time, aged 20 years, 8 months, and 13 days."/>

On 29 October, Rosberg confirmed his departure from Williams at the season's end, officially released from his contract on 1 January 2010. He began receiving advice from three-time world champion Niki Lauda. At the Chinese Grand Prix, the season's third round, Rosberg secured his first pole position and his maiden career victory.
