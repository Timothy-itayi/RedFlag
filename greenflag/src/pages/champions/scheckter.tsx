Growing up in a rural farming community, his upbringing was closely tied to his fatherâ€™s Renault dealership. Scheckter began learning to drive at a young age while working as an engineering apprentice. His driving style, characterized by a flat-out approach, naturally propelled him towards pursuing a career in racing."/>

His Formula 1 debut occurred at the US Grand Prix at Watkins Glen in 1972 with McLaren, where he ran as high as third place before spinning and finishing ninth. After the controversial start to his career, Scheckter moved to Tyrrell in 1974. He won the Swedish Grand Prix in the controversial Tyrrell P34 six-wheeler, and finished third in the championship that year. This included a thrilling race-long battle for the lead in the American Grand Prix between himself and his great friend James Hunt. "/>

Throughout the season, he added two more victories and frequently found himself on the podium. Despite his strong performances, he finished second in the championship behind the dominant Niki Lauda. In 1978, Scheckter continued with the Walter Wolf team but had a less successful season, finishing seventh in the championship standings. "/>
