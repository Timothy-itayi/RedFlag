Constructed in 2003 in the Jiading District of Shanghai, this purpose-built circuit emerged as a symbol of the city's global prominence. Designed by renowned architect Hermann Tilke, the track's development was a monumental endeavor, transforming swampland into a modern racing marvel over 18 months of tireless effort involving thousands of workers. With a sprawling 5.3 sq km site and a construction cost of Â¥2.6 billion, the Shanghai International Racing Course epitomizes China's dedication to showcasing its automotive prowess on the world stage."/>
